1. Target had a massive breach in 2014, in which hacker(s) got into their systems via an HVACs network which had access to Target's network, leapfrogging onto their payment system. 40 million debit/credit cards were stolen. The SOCHI system they used was not password protected, so if you knew the IP address you could gain access. Target has surely tightened up their own security measures and vetting of third party vendors, making sure these vendors are security focused as well.
